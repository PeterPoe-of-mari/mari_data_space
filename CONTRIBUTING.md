# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to Mari.

## Scope of This Repository

This repository contains the **structural specification** (layers, schemas, contracts, test cases, example datasets).

Implementations belong in `mari-engine` — this repository defines requirements and reference formats.

## Workflow

- Uncertainty → open an Issue (discussion)
- Concrete change → submit a Pull Request
- Every change requires at least one example (and, when appropriate, a counterexample)

## Style Guidelines

- Precise, testable statements
- Minimal prose, many examples
- No domain semantics in the core (those belong in Projections or in the Code of Law)

# [P0] Demolition Engine  
## Deterministic Value Extractor

### Goal

Implementation and formal specification of the **Demolition Engine**, the first executable core module of the Mari Engine.

The Demolition Engine deterministically decomposes classical, human-centered data structures (tables, databases, JSON, documents, etc.) into atomic **Values**.

It produces exclusively Values stored in the **Value Store** according to the Value specification.

It produces:
- no index entries
- no order metadata
- no normative evaluations
- no semantic interpretations

It is controlled structural dismantling.

### Principle

Implicit structure (tables, rows, columns, foreign keys) is removed.

Structure does not exist in the Value Store.
Structure emerges later — in the Index and in the Order Layer.

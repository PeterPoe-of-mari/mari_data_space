# [P1] Order Engine  
## Deterministic Order Metadata Writer

### Goal

Implementation of the **Order Engine**.

The Order Engine writes order metadata for existing Values according to the Order File schema.

It describes:
- where a Value originates
- its structural role
- its technical embedding

It defines no meaning, creates no index entries, and makes no normative decisions.

### Principle

The Order Engine links:

Value-ID ↔ Source Structure

A Value can have 0..n Order Files.

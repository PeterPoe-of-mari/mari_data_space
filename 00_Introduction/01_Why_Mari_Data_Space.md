# Why Mari Data Space?

Classical data systems are built around human-centered structures:
tables, fields, implicit schemas, and logic embedded in application code.

Interoperability is often **syntactic** (formats), not **semantic**
(meaning, origin, time, rules).

Mari addresses this structurally:

- Values are stored as raw facts (append-only).
- The Mari Index describes observed behavior and relationships (without norms).
- The Code of Law keeps norms explicit (project-specific).
- The Order Layer contains origin and structure (human-debuggable).
- Projections generate answers and views (ephemeral, derivable).

Result:

AI can operate on a stable memory and structural layering,
while humans retain explicit normative control.

# mari_data_space
Mari Data Space is an open, AI-native data architecture that transforms classical systems (ERP, databases, documents) into an append-only semantic memory layer. It separates raw values, structural metadata, machine index language, and policy rules, enabling interoperability and auditable projections across distributed data systems.
